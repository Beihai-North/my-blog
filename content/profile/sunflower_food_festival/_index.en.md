It was an unforgettable trip where we enjoyed authentic Dongxiang cuisine and shared many joyous moments together. Let me share some of our beautiful memories with you! 📸

## 🎨 Joyful Moments from the Event

### 🌟 6-Year-Old Brother
My younger brother especially loved the variety of delicious food at the event. Dongxiang's hand-grabbed lamb was his favorite! Seeing him enjoy the food so much, it's like he "devoured" the essence of the whole event! 😋

### 🌸 5-Year-Old Niece
My niece was playing in the flower field, as if she had found her own little world. She would occasionally pluck a petal, sometimes jump around the flowers, full of innocent joy. Her smile was as bright as the sunshine! 🌞

### 🏃 9-Year-Old Nephew
My nephew showcased his athletic talent in the community fitness run! He dashed through the finish line like the wind, earning cheers from everyone. For him, this was not just an exercise, but a confidence-boosting experience! 💪

## ❤️ Unforgettable Memories

These photos and videos capture the wonderful time we had at the Sunflower Cultural and Culinary Festival. The children's smiles and joy touched each one of us. I hope we can attend more events like this with our family and create even more beautiful memories in the future! ✨
