It was an unforgettable trip where we enjoyed authentic Dongxiang cuisine and shared many joyous moments together. Let me share some of our beautiful memories with you! 📸\n📷 Family Photos to Capture Precious Moments #\r👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Three Little Mischiefs #\rHere is a photo of three little mischiefs with a vibrant sunflower field in the background. Everyone is smiling, isn’t it a warm and happy scene? 🌻😊\n😄 Same Age as My Niece #\rThis is a photo of 6-year-old Ma Jinshan and his 5-year-old niece. My niece was captivated by the flowers, as happy as a little bee🐝, while my nephew proudly showed off a victory sign✌️, with a face full of pride and confidence.\n🎤 Singing Video Share #\rDuring the event, we captured a special moment where someone was singing🎶.

Dongxiang\u0026rsquo;s hand-grabbed lamb was his favorite! Seeing him enjoy the food so much, it\u0026rsquo;s like he \u0026ldquo;devoured\u0026rdquo; the essence of the whole event! 😋\n🌸 5-Year-Old Niece #\rMy niece was playing in the flower field, as if she had found her own little world. She would occasionally pluck a petal, sometimes jump around the flowers, full of innocent joy. Her smile was as bright as the sunshine! 🌞\n🏃 9-Year-Old Nephew #\rMy nephew showcased his athletic talent in the community fitness run! He dashed through the finish line like the wind, earning cheers from everyone. For him, this was not just an exercise, but a confidence-boosting experience! 💪\n❤️ Unforgettable Memories #\rThese photos and videos capture the wonderful time we had at the Sunflower Cultural and Culinary Festival. The children\u0026rsquo;s smiles and joy touched each one of us. I hope we can attend more events like this with our family and create even more beautiful memories in the future! ✨\nThese photos, videos, and memories will forever be cherished in my heart. I hope you can feel our joy through these shares! 😊📸\n","date":"2024-08-22","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/profile/sunflower_food_festival/","section":"About Me","summary":"Recently, my family and I attended the \u0026ldquo;Hospitable Dongxiang·Shared Peace Feast\u0026rdquo; Sunflower Cultural and Culinary Festival in Dongxiang County.
